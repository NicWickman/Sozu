## Tapping a Global Free Market

Sozu is a crowdsourcing platform in development for the Ethereum and IPFS ecosystem. Companies and individuals can instantly access a global workforce to complete intelligence tasks such as data labelling, transcription and surveys. These employers set their own price, retain their privacy, and pay the lowest fees in the industry.

For workers, Sozu offers a fair and transparent source of income for billions of underbanked and underemployed people around the world. They expose no personally identifiable information, receive payment instantly upon having work accepted, and benefit from complete information about the nature and terms of the work they perform.


## Decentralized Labor, Accessible Jobs

The flourishing Web 3.0 ecosystem holds the philosophies of being Open, Trustless, and Permissionless. Sozu aims to confer the benefits of these philosophies directly to the average person in the form of accessible paid labour. Unrestricted access to this global ocean of human intelligence enables new commercial, scientific and charitable frontiers in an efficient market.


## Customer Stories of the Future

### ActuallyOpenAI Inc.

ActuallyOpenAI is dedicated to creating AI for the benefit of all humanity. They've decided that openness and transparency about their work is important. They are building a new computer vision network and it requires an extraordinary amount of data. To be transparent about their work and subsequent results, ActuallyOpenAI pins all of their new image data to IPFS for the public to access, totalling 100M images.

To label this data, they create a Sozu Job. People around the world label images for $0.01 USD each at an average rate of 1000/hr for a wage of $10/hr. 12,500 workers earn $100 and ActuallyOpenAI has created the world's largest public, labelled image dataset in a single day for $1.1M, with $100k going to Sozu.

### Super-Snapshot Serengeti

An African wildlife conservation organization has deployed hundreds of camera traps in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania to census the wildlife population of several species. Previously, they relied on volunteers to label the thousands of images captured daily. Due to the volume, however, many images sit unlabelled and their data lags.

In 2021, they had a new idea. They create a Sozu Job to label these images, and allow the public to donate to the smart contract. Charitable individuals send cryptocurrency to the Job, providing a financial incentive for what used to be volunteer work. Local Tanzanians earn money by labelling the images, and the organization now has timely data from the park every single day.

### The PerfectFit App

Katerina has built a fitness app called PerfectFit, with hundreds of animated exercises and detailed instructions. She wants to attract more international users, and needs to localize her app in many languages.

She pins her exercise descriptions to IPFS and creates a Sozu Job for each language she wants to localize to. The next day, she's had thousands of native translations submitted for a fraction of the cost of other services. 

### Podcast Portal

Podcast Portal hosts thousands of new podcast episodes each day. One of their benefits to their creators is their "automated" transcription service, which adds a full text transcript to any podcast for a minor fee. They use Sozu to outsource the transcriptions with a short processing time and fewer errors than if they used AI.

### Accessible Entertainment

Accessible Entertainment partners with creators around the world to make their video content accessible to hearing and vision impaired people. AE uses Sozu to crowdsource the annotations and described-video that customers love them for.

### ...And More

These are just a few examples of the value Sozu can bring to projects around the world, both big and small. We look forward to seeing what you can make with a global workforce at your fingertips.
